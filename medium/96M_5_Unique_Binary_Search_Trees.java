 * Question description: Given n, how many structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1...n?

 * Example: Given n = 3, there are a total of 5 unique BST's.

/** 
 * Idea.
 * Two functions: 
 *      G(n): the number of unique BST for a sequence of length n.
 *      F(i, n), 1 <= i <= n: the number of unique BST, where the number i is the root of BST, 
 *           and the sequence ranges from 1 to n.
 *      G(n) = F(1, n) + F(2, n) + ... + F(n, n). 
 * Initialization: there is only one combination to construct a BST out of a sequence of length 1 
 *      (only a root) or 0 (empty tree). G(0) = 1, G(1) = 1. 
 * Function: F(i, n) = G(i-1) * G(n-i), 1 <= i <= n.
 *           G(n) = G(0) * G(n-1) + G(1) * G(n-2) + â€¦ + G(n-1) * G(0);
