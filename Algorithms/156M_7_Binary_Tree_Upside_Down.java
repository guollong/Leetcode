/**
 * Question description: Given a binary tree where all the right nodes are either leaf nodes with a sibling (a left node 
 *		that shares the same parent node) or empty, flip it upside down and turn it into a tree where the original right
 *		nodes turned into left leaf nodes. Return the new root.
 *
 * Example: Given a binary tree {1,2,3,4,5},
 *	    1
 *	   / \
 *	  2   3
 *	 / \
 *	4   5
 * return the root of the binary tree [4,5,2,#,#,3,1].
 *	   4
 *	  / \
 *	 5   2
 *	    / \
 *	   3   1
